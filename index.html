			<h2 class="bio">BIO</h2>
				<p>Technology has always captured my imagination. Starting with Windows 98 I decided that I would center my working career around learning about technology and the repair of computers. I began taking apart and repairing computers for family and friends. Finally in 2010 I had the oppotrunity to achieve a more formal education in the IT industry. I recieved my education through New Horizons Computer Learning Center in Waltham MA, as a result of my schooling I achieved the Comp TIA A+ and N+ certificates as well as Microsofts MCP cert. In 2010 I started my own computer repair business. It was difficult running my own business and I found that after 6 years in business I was not excited about the break/fix work that I was doing, the industry was moving towards remote services and technology was getting more inexpensive as a result of this less and less people were willing to have their devices repaired, so I felt a change was in order. I began learning to code in February of 2017. I am enjoying it thouroughly and am learning alot.

		<h2>My adventures in learning to code</h2>
		
		<p>Lifes ups and downs... I think that I am finally proficient at HTML5. Now the headaches with CSS3 begin. It is interesting to note that HTML and CSS go hand in hand with each other. Until now I have not done much with CSS. I am learning however that there is alot more to it than simple HTML (funny I call it simple now when it was challenging me three weeks ago!) I can see though that it makes my web pages look so much better.
		<br/>
		I guess this process is all about progressive learning. I enjoy the challenge and hope I will continue to enjoy it.
		<br>
		More to come
