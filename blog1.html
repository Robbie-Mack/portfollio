Hello there! my name is Rob McNeil. I am writing this to trace out my journey of learning to code. <b></b>
First of all you might wonder why I want to learn this new skill? That is a good question. I have been in the 
tech industry since 2010. The main focus previously was hardware, as a small business owner I was doing mostly
break/fix computer repair and virus removal. I found that something was lacking in my work life. I did not feel contented or fulfilled with this type of work. I have decided to broaden my horizons and learn something that is both rewarding and creative.

I began learning HTML5 and CSS3. So far I enjoy it very much and I believe that I will do well with it. Since I began a couple of days ago I hve learned quite a bit. There are so many resources on the web to teach me, I feel like a kid in a candy shop! I hope I continue feeling this way!!!
